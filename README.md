# covid-19-forecasting

Pandemics affect the world significantly. Having assumptions about the progress of this pandemic can make the management more effective and solution-oriented. Our aim in this project is to develop different models using statistical methods that can predict the course of the pandemic, that is, the number of cases and deaths. We want to make inferences about the pandemic with data analysis techniques, examine the transmission speed of COVID-19 with the isolation level of people and produce accurate predictions using statistical methods.
